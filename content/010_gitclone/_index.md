## Clone Demo Repo

The quickest way to get started using 
these demonstrations is to 
clone the [`awsdemo`](https://github.com/bwer432/awsdemo) repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/bwer432/awsdemo
```

## Prerequisite to demos: `cdk bootstrap`:

If you have already bootstrapped your 
AWS environment (account + region combination)
to use the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK),
then you could skip the *Bootstrap* topic.

However, if you do not know what that means or 
you have not already done a `cdk bootstrap`
then do that before attempting any of the demos.

{{% notice note %}}
The git repo [`awsdemos`](https://github.com/bwer432/awsdemos) (*plural*) is the source code for the awsdemos.net website.
The git repo [`awsdemo`](https://github.com/bwer432/awsdemo) (*singular*) is the repo of demo scripts and CDK app templates.
These were kept separate (at the risk of confusion from similar names)
so you can clone just [`awsdemo`](https://github.com/bwer432/awsdemo) if all you want is the repo of scripts/CDK examples.
